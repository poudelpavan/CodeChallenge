## Challenge #1: [Solution](https://github.com/poudelpavan/CodeChallenge/blob/master/Challenge1.cs)
Using the programming language of your choice, build a function that takes an array of non-negative integers and an integer, if the array of integers is [1,2,3] we might say it represents the integer 123. The function should add an integer to the number represented by that array but still output an array. 
#### Example 1:
```
Input: [1, 2, 3], 5
Output:[1, 2, 8]
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: [5, 6, 7, 8], 500
Output:[6, 1, 7, 8]
```
